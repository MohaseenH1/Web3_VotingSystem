# Voting System Smart Contract

A decentralized voting system built using Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This smart contract allows users to vote for their preferred political parties in an election and ensures transparency, immutability, and security of votes. 

This system is ideal for scenarios where a fair, decentralized voting mechanism is required, such as online elections or voting for events, candidates, or projects.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting**: Votes are stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Security**: Only authorized voters can vote, and they can only vote once.
- **Transparency**: Results can be viewed once the election ends, with a public record of all votes.
- **Owner Control**: Only the owner (deployer) can add parties and voters, and retrieve the election results.
- **Timed Elections**: The voting period is limited (7 days) after which the results are finalized.
